'''
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,
compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
